    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "1. Import Required Libraries\n",
    "The required libraries are imported, including those for creating AI assistants, searching the web, retrieving article text, and setting up the Streamlit web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set Up Logging\n",
    "Logging is set up to capture and display any errors that occur during the execution of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set Up Streamlit App\n",
    "The title and description of the Streamlit app are set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. User Authentication\n",
    "Input fields are created for the user to enter their OpenAI and SerpAPI keys. These keys are required to access the OpenAI GPT-4 model and perform web searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Initialize Assistants\n",
    "Three assistants are initialized:\n",
    "\n",
    "Searcher: Generates search terms, performs web searches, and returns relevant URLs.\n",
    "Writer: Retrieves text from the URLs and writes a high-quality article.\n",
    "Editor: Coordinates the search and writing tasks, edits and refines the article to ensure it meets high standards.\n",
    "6. Input Field for Article Query\n",
    "Additional input fields are provided for the user to specify the topic, length, and tone of the article they want to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Process the Query and Generate the Article\n",
    "When the user enters a query and specifies the article requirements, the editor assistant coordinates the search and writing tasks to generate the final article. Progress indicators are displayed while the article is being processed, and any errors that occur are logged and displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- User Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated users can use the app by requiring API keys.\n",
    "- Enhanced Input Fields: Captures detailed requirements for the article, such as length and tone.\n",
    "- Logging and Monitoring: Keeps track of errors and other important events for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "- Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors and informs the user.\n",
    "- Progress Indicators: Keeps the user informed about the current state of the process.\n",
    "- Customization Options: Allows users to customize the length and tone of the article, providing more control over the output."
